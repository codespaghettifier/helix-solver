- build - everything generated by the build process
  - Nothing that would cause a problem if deleted.
  - Nothing tracked by a version control system.
- documentation - general documentation, not related to any specific component or library
- application - the directory for application(s) and its components
  - Can use anything from the framework
- Component - a part of the application that is somewhat isolated
  - Eg. handlers, agents, kernels, dispatchers, workers, providers.
  - Business logic.
  - See "Example component/library file structure".
- Group - just a directory
- framework - general puropose elements
  - Eg. types, containers that could be used anywhere.
  - No business logic.
  - No dependency on application.
- Library
  - No business logic.
  - Could be used anywhere in the application.
  - No dependency on application.
  - See "Example component/library file structure".
- CMakeLists.txt
  - No build instruction dependency except for the ones listed below:
    - Could be dependent on files in the same directory.
    - Could be dependent on files in include and src directories (siblings only).
    - Could be dependent on CMakeLists.txt files directly in groups, components, and libraries in the same directory.
  - Contains a list of dependencies for this component/library.
- something.md - documentation regarding something in the same directory
- TODO.md - TODO regarding something in the same directory
- test - application-level tests

- include - component/library headers
  - Must contain only component/library directories (one or several subcomponents).
- include/ComponentName - headers of the component
  - One component/library/sub for CMake library
  - Name must be the same as CMake library name
  - Only header files
- Header
  - One class or enum per file (except for nested classes and enums).
  - Dependencies on components and libraries outside of this component/library should be provided by the build process, based on this component's/library's CmakeLists.txt.
- src - source files for headers in include
- Source
  - Aligned with a respective header.
  - Dependencies on components and libraries outside of this component/library should be provided by the build process, based on this component's/library's CmakeLists.txt.
- test - unit and component tests
  - Tests of all the elements and only the elements introduced in this component/library.
  - Everything that could be tested here should be tested here.
  - One suite per element.
  - Every suite should be named like ElementSuite.cpp (eg. ElementA.h => ElementASuite.cpp)
- test-include - header files for mocks and stubs
  - Must contain only directories for mocks' and stubs' headers (up to 2).
  - Must not contain any files.
- ComponentMock - directory for mock headers
  - Must contain only mocks' headers of elements introduced in this component/library.
  - Must be named like ComponentMock (ExampleComponent => ExampleComponentMock).
- ElementMock header - mock header for respective element
  - Must be named like ElementMock.h (ExampleElement => ExampleElementMock.h).
- ComponentStub - directory for stub headers
  - Must contain only stubs' headers of elements introduced in this component/library.
  - Must be named like ComponentStub (ExampleComponent => ExampleComponentStub).
- ElementStub header - stub header for respective element
  - Must be named like ElementStub.h (ExampleElement => ExampleElementStub.h).
- test-src - source files for headers in test-include
- Mock source
- Stub source
- CMakeLists.txt
  - No build instruction dependency except for the ones listed below:
    - Could be dependent on files in the same directory.
    - Could be dependent on files in include and src directories.
    - Could be dependent on CMakeLists.txt files directly in groups, components, and libraries in the same directory.
  - Contains a lists of dependencies for components and libraries directly in this directory.
  - Contains build instructions for up to 3 CMake libraries:
    - This component/library.
    - Mocks and stubs of elements of this component/library.
    - Test suites.
Something.md - documentation regarding this component/library
TODO.md - TODO regarding something in the same directory
